``pyramid_retry`` is an execution policy for Pyramid that wraps requests and
can retry them a configurable number of times under certain "retryable" error
conditions before indicating a failure to the client.

See https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid-retry/en/latest/
or ``docs/index.rst`` in this distribution for detailed
documentation.
